# Complete System Deployment Guide

## Current Situation

Your new MarketFactory (`0x04a93Cf6b5D573386A9d537B36117dBea56bD57c`) is trying to call the old HybridAMM (`0xB9d59Eb5F16Cf8660fc8855cF64Dfb1c2dB76E7F`), but the old HybridAMM only accepts calls from the old MarketFactory (`0xEB5546fc9d78188a1d905F9fa54957a42f43ed8c`).

**Result**: Market creation transactions are failing.

## Solution: Deploy New HybridAMM

You need to deploy a new HybridAMM contract and update your MarketFactory initialization.

### Step 1: Deploy HybridAMM

**Using Remix IDE** (Easiest):

1. **Go to Remix**: https://remix.ethereum.org

2. **Create Contract File**:
   - New file: `HybridAMM.sol`
   - Copy contents from: `/home/seedslayer/Documents/OracleMarketV2/contracts/HybridAMM.sol`

3. **Compile**:
   - Solidity Compiler tab
   - Version: `0.8.20+`
   - Enable optimization (200 runs)
   - Click "Compile HybridAMM.sol"

4. **Deploy**:
   - Deploy & Run tab
   - Environment: "Injected Provider - MetaMask"
   - Network: Base Sepolia
   - Contract: "HybridAMM"
   - Constructor parameter: `0xE3f7bD9A5dEED21CbdDA5089a44De3938D81c836` (OracleToken)
   - Click "Deploy"
   - **SAVE THE ADDRESS!** (e.g., `0xNEW_HYBRID_AMM_ADDRESS`)

5. **Set MarketFactory** (in Remix after deployment):
   - Expand deployed HybridAMM contract
   - Find `setMarketFactory` function
   - Enter: `0x04a93Cf6b5D573386A9d537B36117dBea56bD57c` (new MarketFactory)
   - Click "transact"
   - Confirm in MetaMask

### Step 2: Re-initialize MarketFactory

Your MarketFactory is already initialized with the OLD HybridAMM. You have two options:

#### Option A: Deploy Fresh MarketFactory (Recommended)

1. **Deploy New MarketFactory** in Remix:
   - Use `/home/seedslayer/Documents/OracleMarketV2/contracts/MarketFactory.sol`
   - No constructor parameters
   - Deploy to Base Sepolia

2. **Initialize** with correct addresses:
   ```
   oracleToken: 0xE3f7bD9A5dEED21CbdDA5089a44De3938D81c836
   hybridAMM: 0xNEW_HYBRID_AMM_ADDRESS (from step 1)
   oracleResolver: 0x5fa6b2bf6e0047914b520619726417a6cBB942E4
   ```

3. **Update Frontend Config**:
   Edit `client/src/contracts/config.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const CONTRACTS = {
     OracleToken: "0xE3f7bD9A5dEED21CbdDA5089a44De3938D81c836" as Address,
     MarketFactory: "0xNEW_MARKET_FACTORY_ADDRESS" as Address, // NEW!
     HybridAMM: "0xNEW_HYBRID_AMM_ADDRESS" as Address, // NEW!
     // ... rest unchanged
   };
   ```

#### Option B: Modify Contract to Allow Re-initialization (Advanced)

This requires modifying the MarketFactory contract to add a `setHybridAMM` function and redeploying.

### Step 3: Test the System

After deployment and configuration:

1. **Create a test market**:
   - Go to Create Market page
   - Make sure you have 110 ORACLE tokens
   - Approve tokens
   - Create market
   - **Should succeed!** âœ…

2. **Verify on BaseScan**:
   - Check transaction succeeded
   - Verify HybridAMM.createMarketPool was called

3. **Test trading**:
   - Navigate to your market
   - Try buying shares
   - Should work without "Market Not On-Chain" error

## Quick Deploy Script

Here's what you need to deploy in order:

```
1. HybridAMM
   Constructor: (oracleToken)
   Values: (0xE3f7bD9A5dEED21CbdDA5089a44De3938D81c836)

2. Call HybridAMM.setMarketFactory()
   Parameter: <MarketFactory address from next step>

3. MarketFactory
   Constructor: () // empty

4. Call MarketFactory.initialize()
   Parameters:
   - oracleToken: 0xE3f7bD9A5dEED21CbdDA5089a44De3938D81c836
   - hybridAMM: <HybridAMM address from step 1>
   - oracleResolver: 0x5fa6b2bf6e0047914b520619726417a6cBB942E4
```

## Addresses Checklist

After deployment, you should have:

- âœ… **OracleToken**: `0xE3f7bD9A5dEED21CbdDA5089a44De3938D81c836` (existing)
- âœ… **OracleResolver**: `0x5fa6b2bf6e0047914b520619726417a6cBB942E4` (existing)
- ðŸ†• **HybridAMM**: `0x...` (new - to deploy)
- ðŸ†• **MarketFactory**: `0x...` (new - to deploy)

## Configuration Files to Update

### 1. `client/src/contracts/config.ts`

```typescript
export const CONTRACTS = {
  OracleToken: "0xE3f7bD9A5dEED21CbdDA5089a44De3938D81c836" as Address,
  MarketFactory: "0xNEW_MARKET_FACTORY" as Address, // UPDATE
  HybridAMM: "0xNEW_HYBRID_AMM" as Address, // UPDATE
  Staking: "0x58eD0a8B6F6972d052A405a6B398cDF480B2EA7D" as Address,
  OrderBook: "0x99aA3F52042586bA4E57D72aCc575057F4853A09" as Address,
  Treasury: "0xa8E97D3A2d64af4037A504835d7EB1788C945e77" as Address,
  Governance: "0xb8fE03037Bdf44497589D75DB3B4ed11C9458AAE" as Address,
  MockUSDC: "0x3fcF28B436f16d08dc1e64E90c93833edd1ba0A1" as Address,
} as const;
```

### 2. Update ABI if needed

The HybridAMM ABI in `config.ts` should match the new contract. Update if there are any differences.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: HybridAMM deployment fails
- **Cause**: Insufficient gas or wrong network
- **Fix**: Make sure you're on Base Sepolia with enough ETH for gas

### Issue: setMarketFactory fails with "Only owner"
- **Cause**: You're not the owner of HybridAMM
- **Fix**: Make sure you're using the same wallet that deployed HybridAMM

### Issue: Market creation still fails
- **Cause**: Frontend still pointing to old contracts
- **Fix**:
  1. Clear browser cache
  2. Verify `config.ts` has new addresses
  3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`

### Issue: "Not initialized" error
- **Cause**: Forgot to call `initialize()` on MarketFactory
- **Fix**: Call `initialize()` with all three required addresses

## Alternative: Simplified Approach

If you want to skip HybridAMM for now and just get markets working:

1. **Use MarketFactorySimple.sol** (already created in `contracts/` folder)
   - This version doesn't require HybridAMM
   - Markets still work, just without automated pricing
   - Trading happens through external systems

2. **Deploy MarketFactorySimple**:
   - Only needs `oracleToken` and `oracleResolver` in `initialize()`
   - Smaller, simpler, fewer dependencies

3. **Add HybridAMM later** when you're ready for full AMM functionality

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. âœ… Deploy HybridAMM
2. âœ… Deploy MarketFactory (or use existing if you can update it)
3. âœ… Initialize both contracts
4. âœ… Update frontend config
5. âœ… Test market creation
6. âœ… Test trading
7. âœ… Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

## Support

If you run into issues:
- Check transaction on BaseScan for specific error messages
- Verify all addresses are correct
- Make sure contracts are initialized
- Check you have enough ORACLE tokens (110 for creating + trading)
